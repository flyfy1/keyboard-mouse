keyboard-mouse
==============

KeyBoard Controlled Mouse.. so that one can operate the mouse simply using keyboard control. Cross Platform


## Ideal Use Case:
1. By pressing a pre-set global shortcut, one is able to move the mouse, fast/slow
2. By pressing another set of key, one is able to perform the mouse's left/middle/right button's click
