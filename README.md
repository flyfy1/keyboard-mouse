keyboard-mouse
==============

KeyBoard Controlled Mouse.. so that one can operate the mouse simply using keyboard control. Cross Platform


## Ideal Use Case:
1. By pressing a pre-set global shortcut, one is able to move the mouse, fast/slow
2. By pressing another set of key, one is able to perform the mouse's left/middle/right button's click

## How To Use:
Ctrl + Shift + `key stroke below`:
- H / J / K / L: following the VIM direction, move the mouse to corresponding direction. The movement would speed up if moved towards the same direction, continously.
- U / I: perform the left/right click

## Further Improvement Can Be done:
- hold / release the mouse key (currently only support key-press)
- hold key to indicate move
- quick movement to certain screen area (drawing upon screen needed)
